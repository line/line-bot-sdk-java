# 2017F COMP3111/3111H Software Engineering Project github 

This is actually part of the course website of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) software enginnering course. The ultimate goal for this cohort students is to develop a chatbot (chatting robot) running on the instance messager LINE. 


## What is this?

This is a repository forked from https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-java. You should use this as a starting point to complete your lab.

# Offline Tutorials

You need to have some backgrounds on Java/Database/git in order to complete the labs. Unfortunately it is unaffortable to cover them in the lecture or at the lab. Some [offline tutorials](./docs/tutorial/) are available for bridging the gap.

# How does the Lab works

2 points are allocated for each lab. You attendance at lab worth one point and completing the lab worth another point. All labs are full house and it is unlikely you can change your lab section. Please seek approval from the instructor if you need to swap your lab. You may complete the lab work at home and come to the lab for demo.
